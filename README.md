# side-project-ideas
This is an attempt to help coalesce ideas in my head in a central location. I don't know if this is the best place for it, but let's try it out!

## ðŸ“– Learning
These are things I want to build to learn something from.

**Real-Time Chat / Slack Clone**
* use socket.io for handling real-time messaging
* have multiple chat rooms to join
* optional: add user management, persist message history to DB
* project goal here is to be able to build a horizontally scalable infrastructure
* would love to use something like [artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) to load test the system

**Real-Time Music Streaming Listening Room aka Slack for Music**
* would be cool to have music listening rooms where people can join to listen to music

**Storefront / Amazon Clone**
* primarily would like to learn how to organize relational data models for an ecomm application

## ðŸ§° Personal Stuff
These are things I'd actually want to use on my day-to-day.

**30-Day Pushup Tracker**
* inspired from this [routine](https://darebee.com/challenges/50-push-ups.html) I found
* most likely a PWA

**Starting Strength Tracker**
* build something similar to SL5x5 [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stronglifts.app&hl=en&gl=us)

**Refrigerator Inventory Management System**
* would be great to have an app that I can use to scan barcodes for grocery items
* use camera on phone to scan the barcode to do a UPC lookup
* would be great to know the expiration date of the item
*
